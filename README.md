## Ravenswood College Endowment Fund – Portfolio Construction Process

### Project Overview
This is an educational step-by-step project demonstrating how an assumed endowment portfolio is designed, allocated, and evaluated using institutional standards.

### Investment Objective
Meet the endowment’s long-term spending needs with moderate risk (15% volatility target) and generate real returns of HEPI + 2%.

### Asset Universe (ETFs)
- IEF – US Treasuries
- SPY – US Equity
- LQD – Investment Grade Corporate Bonds
- EFA – Developed Markets ex-US Equity
- EEM – Emerging Markets Equity
- IYR – Real Estate

### Data Windows
- Historical data modelling: 2016–2019
- Evaluation period: 2023–2024

### Results Summary
- Annualized return (2023–2024): 5.46%
- FY2024 annual return: 6.52%
- Performance exceeded the nominal 5% target
- Outperformed the custom benchmark
- Volatility: 12.4% (within IPS 10–15% band)
- Sharpe ratio: 0.20 (2-yr) → 0.36 (FY2024)
- Sortino ratio: 0.59 (2-yr) → 0.96 (FY2024)

### Main Performance Drivers
Highest contributions:
1. US Equity (SPY)
2. Emerging Markets (EEM)
3. Developed ex-US (EFA)

Volatility highest in:
- EEM (policy uncertainty – China)
- IYR (real estate sensitivity)

Treasuries (IEF) provided stability.

### Conclusion
The endowment met both its absolute (real return objective) and relative (benchmark) targets, maintained liquidity (>50%), and operated within its risk budget. The assumptions validated the strength of the SAA framework and supported sustainability of the College’s long-term spending goals.
